This is a configurable discord bot that uses Hugging Face's Inference Endpoint API to interact with queries sent to a Open Source LLM by a discord user.
As stated in the code, the model can be prompted with the command "!ask" preceeding an arbitrary amount of text
Note:
  The model may take time to generate a response, so be patient. Also, for this to remain free, you must use a model < 10GB in size. I chose LaMini-GPT-1.5B, but you can use any one that works
